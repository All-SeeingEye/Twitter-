# Twitter-

Getting data of some of the most followers on Twitter
The people I have chosen are.



/////////drum roll please ///////////



1. Christian Ronaldo
2. Katty Perry
3. Elon Musk
4. Narendra Modi
5. Taylor Swift.


I will make a 6 csv files one for each person and one with all of them, the csv file will contain their all tweets; max to 3000 tweets as twitter doenst allow more than that, I will think of what do with this overall_csv file in future.

I have removed tokens in keys.py for security so keep that in mind if you what to fork the project.
